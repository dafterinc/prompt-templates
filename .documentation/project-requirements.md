### Data Synchronization
- **FR5.1**: Templates must be stored locally for offline access

- **FR5.3**: Conflicts between local and cloud data must be resolved with clear user choices

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NFR1.1**: The application must load within 2 seconds on average connections
- **NFR1.2**: Template operations (create, edit, delete) must complete within 1 second
- **NFR1.3**: The application must function without internet connection
- **NFR1.4**: Synchronization must happen in the background without blocking the UI

### Usability

- **NFR2.3**: The application must have a clean, intuitive interface with minimal learning curve
- **NFR2.4**: Error messages must be clear and actionable

### Security
- **NFR3.1**: User data must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- **NFR3.2**: Authentication must use secure practices (JWT, proper session management)
- **NFR3.3**: Templates must be private to users by default
- **NFR3.4**: The application must implement proper input validation and output encoding

### Scalability
- **NFR4.1**: The architecture must support future team collaboration features
- **NFR4.2**: The database design must accommodate growing numbers of templates per user
- **NFR4.3**: The system must support thousands of concurrent users

### Maintainability
- **NFR5.1**: Code must follow best practices and be well-documented
- **NFR5.2**: The application must have a comprehensive test suite
- **NFR5.3**: The project must use modern build tools and dependency management
- **NFR5.4**: The deployment process must be automated

## Constraints
- Limited initial development resources
- MVP must be delivered within 2-3 months
- Focus on simplicity and core functionality first
- Must use Svelte, ShadCN, and Supabase as the primary technologies

## Future Requirements (Not in MVP)
- Team collaboration features
- Template sharing and permissions
- Advanced template versioning
- Analytics on template usage
- AI-assisted template creation
